Certainly! How about a Real-Time Task Management System?

Application Idea: Real-Time Task Management System

Tech Stack:

PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
Socket.IO for real-time updates and notifications
Redis for caching task data and session management
File system (fs) for storing task-related files temporarily before uploading to S3
File upload to Amazon S3 for secure storage of task-related files
Amazon SES for sending email notifications (e.g., task assignments, updates, deadlines)
Features:

User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles. Different roles such as admin, manager, and team member can be implemented.
Task Creation: Users can create tasks, assign them to team members, set due dates, and add descriptions and attachments.
Real-Time Updates: Utilize Socket.IO to provide real-time updates on task statuses, such as when a task is created, assigned, completed, or modified.
Task Tracking: Users can track the progress of tasks, view assigned tasks, and filter tasks based on various criteria such as status, priority, and due date.
File Attachments: Allow users to upload files related to tasks. Files can include documents, images, or any other relevant materials. Use Amazon S3 for secure storage of these files.
Notifications: Send email notifications using Amazon SES to users for important task-related events, such as task assignments, approaching deadlines, or task completions.
Comments and Discussions: Enable users to leave comments on tasks, facilitating discussions and collaboration among team members.
Search and Filtering: Implement search and filtering functionalities to help users find tasks based on criteria like title, assignee, status, or priority.
Dashboard and Reports: Provide users with a dashboard to get an overview of their tasks and generate reports on task completion rates, performance metrics, etc.
Integration with Calendar: Integrate with calendar applications to sync task due dates and deadlines, providing users with a comprehensive view of their schedules.
This application would streamline task management for teams by providing a centralized platform for creating, assigning, tracking, and collaborating on tasks in real-time.
